## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* A Unix-like operating system: macOS, Linux, BSD. On Windows: WSL2 is preferred, but cygwin or msys also mostly work.
* `git` should be installed (recommended v2.25.1 or higher)
* `node` should be installed (recommended v12.18.3 or higher)
* `npm` should be installed (recommended v6.14.6 or higher)
* `curl` should be installed

#### Install all prerequisites(optional):
To install the latest stable version of `git`, `node`, `npm` and `curl` use the following script. This will install node and npm via nvm.
```shell
sudo sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zlfnhmd/setup/master/prerequisites.sh)"
```
